# What is variables ?
variables is just like a container/jar or a box in which we store different types of data.
     and we all familiar with the box or jar , in real life you  know very well every box has name as same as in python when store any data in the box or jar so we have to give it the name of that jar.

# Rules for Creating Variables 
1) for creating variables letter , digit and underscore is allowed only.
2) variables names never start with a digit 
3) spaces is not allowed : use underscore for a space.
4) python is a case senstitive language means name and Name are both different variables 

ex- name_surname = rohit sharma

note = literal = means direct value like akash , 45 ,89.7 value van be anything.
# Datatypes = 
Types of datatypes 
1) integer datatypes = means purely a number without any decimal.
2) floating datatypes = means decimal values 
3) string datatypes = means character , word or any english sentence.
4) Boolean datatypes = means it returns true and false according to condition.
5) list datatypes = it is type of datatype in which store multiples of different type of data  in this list datatypes.
                       list is mutable .
6) Tuples datatypes =  it is similar to list but it is immutable .
7) Dectionary = it refers key : value pair , just like real dictionary having word and its meaning as similar as  In  python dictionary it totally ups to you  what  you put the word and its meaning .
